# Don't

![Live frugally. Just Don't.](https://github.com/clanderson87/dont/blob/master/icon.png)

Wanna drop $45 on [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com) for a sweet Prime Pantry Box? No, you don't.

Wanna check out the latest foreign knock-offs on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com)? No, you don't.

Love that new organic, free-range phonecase from [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com)? No, you don't.

Don't stops frivolous spending by disabling or removing buy buttons on major e-commerce sites. Install it via the Chrome Web Store. Enable or disable it via the `chrome://extensions` manager. *(just copy and paste that in Chrome's address bar)*

Live frugally. Just don't.
