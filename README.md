# Don't

[logo]: https://github.com/clanderson87/icon.png

Wanna drop $45 on [amazon](https://smile.amazon.com) for a new usb drive? No you don't.

Wanna check out the latest foreign knock-offs on [eBay](https://www.ebay.com)? No you don't.

Love that new artisanial, organic, free range phonecase from [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com)? No, you don't.

Don't stops frivolous spending by disabling or removing buy buttons on major e-commerce sites. Install it via the Chrome Web Store. Enable or disable it via the [chrome extension manager](chrome://extensions).

Live frugally. Just don't.
